				Jon Duckett's book titled, HTML and CSS Design and Build Websites, is
				what got me hooked on the dream of being a Front-End Web Developer. I
				loved learning how to make the seemingly, "magical and mysterious",
				visual website effects! I spent all of my free-time and weekends problem
				solving and learning about JavaScript, and applying what I learned on
				small projects. After eight months had passed, I started feeling
				comfortable with many of the implementations that HTML, CSS, and
				JavaScript play part of in the web development process.

				I took an offer from a senior mentor in the Software Engineering
				industry and became his full-time student for two months. Those two
				months were a full-time one-on-one class creating projects in C++ and
				utilizing Linux and command line Git for version control. This was a key
				foundation in my education, because I got to use and grow my logical
				thinking and problem solving with manipulating differing types of data.

				After my two month mentorship on C++, I started a Devmountain bootcamp
				specializing as a Full-Stack Web Developer using JavaScript, ReactJS,
				CSS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, SQL, and many other advancing technologies.
				After graduating the Devmounain Bootcamp, I have continued building
				Full-Stack web applications focusing on Front-End Web Development. I
				love problem solving and contributing to the world of Front-End Web
				Development!
